# Test cases
print(repeating_letter_a("banana"))         # True
print(repeating_letter_a("pineapple"))       # False
print(repeating_letter_a("Animal Kingdom"))  # True
print(repeating_letter_a("A is for apple"))   # True

# In this code, re.IGNORECASE is used to make the pattern case-insensitive, allowing it to match both uppercase
# and lowercase "a". The .* in the regular expression allows for any characters (or none) between the two "a"
# occurrences. Now, the function should correctly return True if the letter "a" appears at least twice in
#  the input text and False otherwise.
